In this repository we have reproduced the structure of our working directory. We explain the content:
- **main.py** is the main jupyter notebook where we run and commented the analysis.
- **hw3_functions.py** is the python file that contains all the functions that we have used to produce our analysis.
- the folders **art** and **all_pages** are empty, we are only reporting them to explain our code structure. 
- We also add the intermediate files that we have created during our analysis: *d_vector.txt, inverted_index.txt, url.txt, articles_with_plot.txt,small_inverted_index_score.zip*. These files should allow to execute the query on any computer.
